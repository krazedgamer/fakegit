Hello!

In order to get a free TShirt from the FreeTail Hackers, you have to commit once a day, from April 7, 2016 to May 7, 2016. For those who are lazy, or don't have the time, or just forgot on one day, feel free to use this code to commit for you! Download fakegit.py, and run with 'python fakegit.py', input your username and which repo on github you want it to write to (make sure it exists), and then it will generate a shell script that will write everything for you. All 30 days. It doesn't matter when you run this program, it will commit for everything. Just run 'sh fakegit.sh' and it will hopefully work for you!

Use at your own descretion. If Prakhar hates you for it, thats your problem. (Hi Prakhar! :D Don't hate me pls). If it doesn't work, its most likely because my configuration and code are currently setup to use SSH, rather than HTTPS. If you have no idea what that means, you might just want to learn how to use git normally anyways.

Thanks, and happy committing.
